Catenary Problem

The problem is to find the shape of a hanging chain. It can be defined as the configuration that minimizes the potential energy.

Objective: linear
Constraints: convex quadratic
Feasible set: convex

This model finds the shape of a hanging chain
The solution is known to be y = cosh(a*x) + b
for appropriate a and b.

This problem is a port to Julia/JuMP of a model by Professor Robert Vanderbei
at Princeton University, originally written in AMPL.
